# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game built with vanilla JavaScript, where the player has to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. The player has 20 attempts to guess the number correctly. The game also features a high score that tracks the best score the player has achieved.

## Game Rules

1. The secret number is randomly chosen between 1 and 20.
2. The player must guess the secret number by inputting their guess into the input field and clicking the "Check" button.
3. If the player guesses correctly, the background color changes, and the secret number is revealed. The player is congratulated, and the score is updated.
4. If the guess is incorrect, the game will give feedback, telling the player if the guess was too high or too low. The score decreases by 1 for every incorrect guess.
5. If the score reaches 0, the player loses the game.
6. The player can start a new game by clicking the "Again" button.
